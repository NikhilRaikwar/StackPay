## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

### Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the StackPay frontend project. The project uses React with Vite, React Router, and TypeScript.

### Changes Made

#### Modified Files
1. **frontend/src/App.tsx**
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<BrowserRouter>` at the root App level
   - Placement: After BrowserRouter opens, before AuthManager and other route handlers
   - This ensures analytics tracking is enabled for all routes in the application

2. **frontend/package.json**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` (v1.6.1) to dependencies

3. **frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml**
   - Updated with new dependency and its transitive dependencies

### Implementation Details

**Framework:** React with TypeScript and Vite
**Analytics Version:** @vercel/analytics@1.6.1 (latest)
**Integration Approach:** React component wrapper for seamless integration

The Analytics component was placed inside the BrowserRouter to ensure:
- All route transitions are tracked
- Page views are automatically recorded
- User interactions can be monitored
- No route support limitations (unlike the `inject()` function)

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Route Tracking:** The Analytics component automatically detects route changes through React Router and sends them to Vercel's analytics endpoint
2. **Page View Recording:** Each time a user navigates to a different page, a page view is recorded
3. **Network Tab:** When deployed to Vercel, network requests to `/_vercel/insights/view` and `/_vercel/insights/script.js` will be visible in the browser's Network tab
4. **Data Dashboard:** Once deployed to Vercel and receiving traffic, analytics data will be available in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

### Verification

- ✅ Build completes successfully with no new errors
- ✅ Package installed correctly (v1.6.1)
- ✅ Import statement properly formatted
- ✅ Analytics component correctly placed in component tree
- ✅ Lockfile updated with new dependencies

### Prerequisites for Full Functionality

To fully enable Vercel Web Analytics:
1. Project must be deployed to Vercel
2. Analytics must be enabled in the Vercel dashboard (Analytics tab → Enable)
3. After deployment, the app will start sending analytics data automatically
4. Data will begin appearing in the Vercel dashboard after initial traffic

### Next Steps

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Visit the Vercel dashboard and enable Web Analytics (if not already enabled)
2. Monitor the Analytics tab for visitor data, page views, and other metrics
3. Use the filtering tools to analyze performance and user behavior
4. For advanced tracking, custom events can be added using the `track()` function from `@vercel/analytics/react`
